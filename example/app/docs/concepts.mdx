## Concepts

This section covers some of the core concepts of xorm.

### Store

In xorm, your state is held in a centralized store which you can think of as a reactive in-memory database.

<img
  src="/store-structure.png"
  className="w-full mb-6 bg-white/[0.5%] rounded-xl"
/>

Each model in this store has a corresponding collection and each collection holds model instances.

Model instances are special however, because only one instance will ever exist per id.

Consider the following scenario.

```tsx
const task1 = TaskModel.create({ id: "123", task: "Remove dead code" });
const task2 = TaskModel.create({ id: "123", task: "Refactor state" });
const task3 = TaskModel.create({ id: "456", task: "Add fullscreen dialog" });
console.log(task1.task); // "Refactor state"
console.log(task2.task); // "Refactor state"
console.log(task3.task); // "Add fullscreen dialog"
console.log(task1 === task2); // true
console.log(task2 === task3); // false
```

Note that `task1` and `task2` refer to the same model instance. This is because xorm guarantees that only one model instance exists per id.

So when we attempt to create `task2`, what actually happens under the hood is xorm sees the existing `TaskModel` instance associated with id `123` and updates the instance's data by calling `instance.loadJSON({ id: "123", task: "Refactor state" })`.
