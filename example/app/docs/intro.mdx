## Intro

Xorma is a synchronous, reactive, in-memory database powered by mobx.

I have found it to be amazing for building editor-like experiences that maintain complex object graphs with lots of write operations.

I hacked together the first version of xorma back in 2022 when I set out to build Diode, a web-based 3d circuit simulator.

It worked remarkably well and I have continued to use this foundation when building other editor-like experiences.
